🎨 THEME APPLICATION BASE PROMPT

(For Existing Designs – Do NOT Change Layout)

You are a professional UI/UX and graphic designer.
You are given an existing design layout.
Your task is to apply the CleanLab Pro color theme and styling to the provided design WITHOUT changing its structure, layout, or content placement.

🚫 Layout Rule (VERY IMPORTANT)

Do NOT redesign

Do NOT rearrange elements

Do NOT add or remove sections

Preserve:

Spacing

Alignment

Image positions

Typography hierarchy

Only update colors, styling, and visual consistency

🎨 Mandatory Color Theme

Apply this palette strictly:

Primary Blue: #2F80ED
(Buttons, main highlights, headers)

Dark Navy: #1F3A5F
(Headlines and key text)

Soft Gray: #F4F6F8
(Cards, containers, background blocks)

White: #FFFFFF
(Primary background)

Rules:

Keep the design light and clean

Blue is an accent, not the background

Maintain strong contrast and readability
